# HunYuan3D Experiments (ComfyUI)
Exploring workflows to generate 3D assets from multi-view iPhone photos using the HunYuan3D Multiview to Model nodes in ComfyUI.  

**Why:** In production, fast turnaround for asset prototyping can save artists significant time.  
**What I tried:** Testing node graphs for multi-view reconstruction â†’ mesh output.  

## Trials

### Attempt 1
<img width="1906" height="1086" alt="Attempt 1" src="resources/screenshot01.png" />

### Attempt 2
 + Re-run with the same settings (better, learned result!)
 + The background monitors appear in the .GLB model

<br>
<img width="1905" height="1083" alt="Attempt 2.2" src="resources/screenshot03.png" />

### Attempt 3
 + Attempted to adjust KSampler "cfg" parameter to 8.0
<img width="1110" height="754" alt="Attempt 3" src="resources/screenshot04.png" />

### Attempt 4
 + Re-took picture with a clearer background
 + Attempted to adjust Ksampler sampler_name model to "dpm_2" with "cfg" set to 8.0 (worse results)
<img width="1901" height="1087" alt="Attempt 4" src="resources/screenshot05.png" />

### Attempt 5
 + Added a painted "Mask" to the supplied images
 + Set KSampler "sampler_name" model back to "euler"
 + Set KSampler "cfg" back to 4.0
 + Improved, but still overall malformed (Appears that screenspace size of object was too small for the model to distinguish features - possibly from iphone photo compression)
<img width="1900" height="1090" alt="Attempt 5" src="resources/screenshot06.png" />

## Takeaway:
Promising results for small props taken up-close, with clean backgrounds and a user-defined mask; still limited fidelity for hero assets. Also, results appear to improve on subsequent re-runs.

### Notes:
 + Observed that defining a mask rotates source images 90 degrees CCW
 + Euler seemed like the best sampler model to use from limited trial set - further experimentation of the rest of the models is recommended
